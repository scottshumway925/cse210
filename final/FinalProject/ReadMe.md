This program is a short game centered around resource gathering and time management. There are three activities that you can perform in this program: foraging, crafting, and selling. You will have a specific amount of actions to spend each day, and once the day's over, if you don't have enough money, your game will end. The game will exponentially get harder as time moves on, making the game harder until the eventual game over happens. There is no save funcitonality, so it is to be played all at once. 
This program utilizes many different classes in order to funciton. Overall, there are 9 classes, with 4 of them being a base class with derived classes coming from it. I researched many different aspects of programming in C# to get this program working, including dictionaries and hashsets. I spent a total of 12 hours programming this.
