Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and Objects

Classes are like recipes, objects, or instances of a class, are like cakes.
Objects combine variables and functions into one datatype.



Nouns for journal program:
- journal
- journalentry
- menu
- questions
- program 

Journal (save, load, display) : Entries
Entry (create, display) : date, prompt, response

The create method is in the entry class because it simplifies the creation process. Doing it this way simplifies
the code by making it so that all the variables needed to create an entry are local. 

JournalEntry myJournalEntry = new JournalEntry();
myJournalEntry.Create();
myJournal.entries.add(myJournalEntry);
