Abstraction: To simplify

Encapsulation: To gather/bundle

Inheritance: to inherit from parent/base




Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and Objects

Classes are like recipes, objects, or instances of a class, are like cakes.
Objects combine variables and functions into one datatype.



Nouns for journal program:
- journal
- journalentry
- menu
- questions
- program 

Journal (save, load, display) : Entries
Entry (create, display) : date, prompt, response

The create method is in the entry class because it simplifies the creation process. Doing it this way simplifies
the code by making it so that all the variables needed to create an entry are local. 

JournalEntry myJournalEntry = new JournalEntry();
myJournalEntry.Create();
myJournal.entries.add(myJournalEntry);



Journal
_entries: List<Entry>

AddEntry: void
Display: void
WriteToFile: void
ReadFromFile: string

JournalEntry
_date: string
_prompt: string
_response: string

JournalEntry(): void



public static string ToString() {
    string outputString = ""

}




public void ReadFromFile(string filename) {
    string[] lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(filename);

    foreach (string line in lines) {
        string[] parts = line.Split("#");

        string date = parts[0];
        string question = parts[1];
        string entryText = parts[2];

        JournalEntry entry = new JournalEntry();
        entry.CreateEntryWithData(date, question, entryText);
        this.AddEntry(entry);
    }
}
